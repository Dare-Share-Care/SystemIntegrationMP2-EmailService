## Step 1: Create a Configuration File

Create a new file in the root of your project named appsettings.Secrets.json. This file will contain your sensitive information.
```json
{
  "EmailSettings": {
    "FromEmail": "your_gmail_address@gmail.com",
    "FromName": "Your Name",
    "Password": "your_gmail_password"
  }
}
```
